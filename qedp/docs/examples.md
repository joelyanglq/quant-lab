# Examples Module

## Overview

The `examples` module provides working code examples demonstrating how to use the QEDP framework. These examples serve as starting points for building your own strategies and understanding framework usage patterns. The module is currently under development but will include progressively complex examples.

## Planned Components

### Basic Examples
- **Hello World Strategy**: Simple buy-and-hold implementation
- **Data Loading**: How to load and process market data
- **Basic Backtest**: Complete minimal backtesting setup

### Strategy Examples
- **Moving Average Crossover**: Classic technical strategy
- **Mean Reversion**: Statistical arbitrage approach
- **Pairs Trading**: Relative value strategy
- **Momentum Strategy**: Trend-following approach

### Advanced Examples
- **Multi-Asset Strategy**: Trading across different asset classes
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Modern portfolio theory implementation
- **Risk Parity**: Alternative risk allocation
- **Machine Learning Strategy**: ML-based signal generation

### Integration Examples
- **Live Trading Setup**: Connecting to live data feeds
- **Custom Data Sources**: Implementing new data providers
- **Custom Fee Models**: Implementing broker-specific costs
- **Reporting Integration**: Connecting to analytics platforms

## Design Principles

### Progressive Complexity
Examples build from simple to advanced concepts.

### Real-World Relevance
Examples use realistic trading scenarios and data.

### Educational Focus
Each example includes detailed explanations and best practices.

## Learning Path

### Level 1: Framework Basics
1. Setting up a basic backtest
2. Loading historical data
3. Implementing simple strategies
4. Understanding results

### Level 2: Strategy Development
1. Technical indicator implementation
2. Signal generation and filtering
3. Position sizing strategies
4. Risk management integration

### Level 3: Advanced Techniques
1. Multi-factor models
2. Machine learning integration
3. Cross-asset strategies
4. Production deployment

## Example Structure

Each example includes:
- **Overview**: What the strategy does and why
- **Code**: Complete, runnable implementation
- **Configuration**: Parameter settings and explanations
- **Results**: Expected performance and analysis
- **Extensions**: Ways to modify and improve the strategy

## Assumptions for Beginners

If you're new to the framework:

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic examples and gradually increase complexity
- **Copy and Modify**: Use examples as templates for your own strategies
- **Understand First**: Read the code and comments before running
- **Experiment**: Change parameters and observe effects
- **Debug**: Use logging and print statements to understand execution flow

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper error handling
- Configuration management
- Logging best practices

### Strategy Development
- Parameter sensitivity analysis
- Overfitting avoidance
- Risk management integration
- Performance attribution

### Testing and Validation
- Backtesting methodology
- Result validation
- Statistical significance testing
- Out-of-sample testing

## Future Development

Examples will be added incrementally as framework components are completed. Priority will be given to commonly requested strategies and integration patterns.
